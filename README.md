# MLOps Mastery: Production ML with PyTorch & Airflow

**A comprehensive, hands-on course to master end-to-end MLOps.**

Transform from novice to expert in production machine learning systems using:
- **Apache Airflow** for ETL and orchestration
- **PyTorch** for model development and training
- **Production patterns** for deployment, monitoring, and retraining

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have a complete, production-grade MLOps system:

- ✅ ETL pipelines with data validation and quality checks
- ✅ Feature engineering workflows with versioning
- ✅ PyTorch models (tabular, ranking/two-tower architectures)
- ✅ Automated training pipelines with experiment tracking
- ✅ Model serving API (batch and online inference)
- ✅ Monitoring and drift detection
- ✅ Automated retraining loops

## 📚 Course Materials

- **[CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md)**: Complete 4-phase learning path with detailed labs
- **[PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)**: Project organization and best practices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1: Foundations (Start Here!)
Learn the MLOps lifecycle, Airflow basics, and PyTorch fundamentals.

### Phase 2: Data & Pipelines
Build production ETL and feature engineering with Airflow.

### Phase 3: Modeling & Training
Integrate PyTorch training into Airflow, implement experiment tracking.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring
Deploy models, implement monitoring, close the feedback loop.

## 🎓 Who Is This For?

**Target Student**: Senior Software Engineer transitioning to ML/MLOps
- Strong Python and backend systems experience
- New to PyTorch, Airflow, and end-to-end MLOps
- Want to understand AND implement the full ML lifecycle

## 📊 The MLOps Loop

```
DATA → TRAIN → DEPLOY → MONITOR → RETRAIN → (loop)
```

Every component you build fits into this loop. By Phase 4, you'll orchestrate the entire cycle automatically.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Modeling**: PyTorch
- **Serving**: FastAPI
- **Monitoring**: Custom drift detection
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow or custom
- **Languages**: Python 3.10+

## 📈 Progress

- [ ] Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring

## 🏗 Project Structure

The project grows incrementally through each phase. See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for the complete architecture.

## 🤝 Learning Approach

1. **Code-first, pragmatic**: Real implementations, no pseudocode
2. **Incremental complexity**: Build on previous work
3. **Review & iterate**: Get feedback, improve, master
4. **Portfolio-grade**: Every lab contributes to the final system

## 📖 Next Steps

1. Read [CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md) for the complete learning path
2. Set up your development environment (guide in Phase 1)
3. Start with Lab 1.1: Your first Airflow DAG
