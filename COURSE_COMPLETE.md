## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /home/user/mlops-learning-plan

# 2. Read getting started
cat GETTING_STARTED.md

# 3. Set up environment (5-10 minutes)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize Airflow
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/airflow
airflow db init
airflow users create --username admin --password admin \
    --firstname Admin --lastname User --role Admin \
    --email admin@example.com

# 5. Start learning!
cd docs/phase1
cat README.md
```

## 💡 How to Use Solutions

### **Best Practice**
```
1. Try implementing yourself first ← Most learning happens here!
2. Get stuck? Check hints in solution README
3. Still stuck? Look at solution code
4. Compare your solution to provided one
5. Understand WHY solution is written that way
```

### **Quick Solution Access**
```bash
# View any solution
cd solutions/phase1/lab1_1_solution
cat README.md

# Run any solution
python hello_airflow.py  # (after copying to dags/)

# Compare your work
diff your_solution.py lab1_1_solution/hello_airflow.py
```
